A *FAILED* test application for Augmented Reality and Google Tango Motion Tracking (Jave)

I started witht he Tango Motion Capture demo and tried to add a caemra image to the background.  I was not successful.

This code creates an OpenGL scene with a transparent background.  But the background image from the camera is coming across black.

I think it has to do with my layouts.
