A test application for Augmented Reality and Google Tango Motion Tracking (Java)

I started with the Tango SDK MotionCapture demo and added a caemra image to the background using the Tango *connectSurface* approach.

The demo is not a validated AR application and is only to demonstrate (a) how to use a Tango connectSurface call to a SurfaceView  and (b) create an OpenGL scene over the camera view.  

The Camera and Tango need careful calibration to ensure the Augented Reality registration is as accurate as possible.
